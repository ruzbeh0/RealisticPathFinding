##Realistic Pathfinding

Make your citizens choose routes that feel closer to real life.

**BETA**: This mod is in early development. Overrall it is working but some adjustments might still be needed. Please report any issues on the forum or on discord.

##What to expect?

When using this mod you should expect to have less transit trips and more walk and driving trips. The vanilla game makes transit more attractive than it should. For example, it does not consider waiting times and transfer times when deciding if transit should be used. Those are very important in a real world travel demand model. This mod adds those to PathFinding, which also means that number of vehicles in a route has a greater effect: more vehicles means less waiting time which makes a route more attractive. It also means that cims will prefer to walk over taking a bus for just a short distance.

##Transit

* Waiting times: add waiting transit waiting times when trying to decided if transit should be used, also adds a adjustment factor to give timetabled modes (rail/ship/air) a lower perceived wait.

* Transfer penalty: adds a penalty for transit trips with transfer, making direct trips more attractive.

* Crowding effect: packed stops will attract less riders.

* Mode feel: set different “ride comfort” weights for bus, tram, subway, and train.

##Walking

* Age-based walking speeds (averaging ~3 mph across the population).

* Long-distance aversion: very long all-walk trips become less attractive, short walks stay untouched.

##Driving

* Turn delays at intersections (with extra for sharp turns/U-turns).

* Road hierarchy bias: prefers main roads, discourages neighborhood cut-throughs and alley rat-runs.

* Congestion avoidance: vehicles avoid roads with heavy traffic.

##Tweakable
Everything is configurable with simple in-game sliders—dial it toward realism or efficiency to fit your city.
